A blocked drain can quickly become a major headache, leading to unpleasant odours, slow drainage, and even potential property damage. [At 1st Response Drainage](/), we provide expert drain unblocking services across Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire ensuring your drainage issues are resolved swiftly and effectively. With our 24/7 emergency call-out service, you can count on us whenever trouble strikes.

One of the most common causes of domestic drain blockages is something many households pour down the sink without thinking twice: cooking oils and grease. These substances might seem harmless when warm and liquid, but once they cool and harden inside your pipes, they can create serious build-ups. Over time, they trap food scraps, soap, hair and other debris, resulting in stubborn blockages that can bring your plumbing to a standstill.

Here’s how to prevent these issues from happening in the first place.

## Why Oils and Grease Block Drains

When you pour hot oil, melted butter, or grease from pans down the drain, they may flow easily at first. But once inside your plumbing system, they begin to cool. As they cool, they solidify, clinging to the inside of your pipes like glue. Over time, layer after layer builds up, narrowing the pipe’s diameter and restricting water flow.

Even small, repeated amounts of fat can cause a major blockage. Add food particles and soap residue to the mix, and you’ve got the perfect storm for a clogged drain.

## Common Signs of Grease Blockages

If you’re experiencing any of the following, your drain may already be suffering from a build-up of grease:

- Slow draining water in your sink
- Gurgling sounds from the plughole
- Bad smells rising from the sink or plug
- Water backing up when you use the washing machine or dishwasher

The sooner you act, the better. Ignoring these signs can lead to full blockages or even burst pipes.

## How to Prevent Grease Build-Up in Your Drains

1. Never Pour Oils or Grease Down the Sink

This is the golden rule. No matter how small the amount, avoid pouring any cooking oils, bacon fat, or gravy down your sink. Let the grease cool, then pour it into a container like an empty tin or glass jar. Once it has solidified, you can throw it in the bin.

2. Wipe Pans and Plates Before Washing

After cooking, use paper towels to wipe greasy pans, baking trays and plates before washing them. This removes the bulk of the grease and prevents it from entering your sink in the first place.

3. Use a Sink Strainer

A simple mesh sink strainer will catch food scraps and stop them from going down the plughole. It’s an inexpensive way to prevent larger debris from combining with any leftover grease and causing blockages.

4. Run Hot Water and Soap After Greasy Wash-Ups

If you’ve just washed something oily, run hot water with a squirt of washing-up liquid for 30 seconds afterwards. This can help flush small traces of grease through the pipes before they solidify. Just remember, this doesn’t make it safe to pour fat down the drain—it only helps clear the little bits that slip through.

5. Educate Everyone in the House

Prevention only works if everyone is on board. Make sure everyone in your household knows not to pour fats and oils down the sink. Even small mistakes repeated regularly can undo your efforts.

6. Schedule Routine Drain Maintenance

If your property is prone to drainage issues, or if you run a business like a café or catering service, regular drain maintenance is key. At 1st Response Drainage, we offer preventative cleaning to keep your system running smoothly.
