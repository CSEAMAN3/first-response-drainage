A blocked drain can turn into a nightmare in no time. From bad smells in the kitchen to water backing up in the bathroom, drainage problems can disrupt your day and damage your home. [At 1st Response Drainage](/), we’ve seen it all. As your local drain [plumber in Suffolk](/drainage-services), we respond quickly and fix the issue before it gets worse.

Here are the most common causes of drain emergencies we handle and how you can avoid them.

## 1. Fat, Oil and Grease Build-Up

This is one of the top culprits behind kitchen sink blockages. When you pour fat, oil or grease down the drain, they may seem harmless in liquid form. But as they cool, they solidify and stick to the inside of your pipes. Over time, this builds up and restricts water flow, eventually leading to a total blockage.

Tip: Instead of pouring grease down the sink, collect it in a container and bin it once solid.

## 2. Hair Accumulation

In bathrooms, hair is a major cause of slow-draining water and blocked pipes. It easily wraps around soap scum and debris, forming dense clumps that get trapped in the u-bend or drain trap. Left untreated, this can cause water to back up into your shower or bath.

Tip: Use a drain guard to catch hair before it goes down the plughole and clean it regularly.

## 3. Wet Wipes and Non-Flushables

Despite being marketed as “flushable,” most wet wipes do not break down like toilet paper. When flushed, they catch on rough pipe edges and combine with other materials like fat and hair, forming hard blockages deep within your drainage system.

We regularly get called out as an emergency drain plumber in Suffolk to clear pipes clogged with wipes, nappies and hygiene products.

Tip: Only flush paper!

## 4. Tree Roots in Pipes

Tree roots are surprisingly aggressive. They seek out moisture and can find their way into even the smallest cracks in underground pipes. Once inside, they grow quickly and block the flow of wastewater, often causing serious damage to the drainage system.

Tip: If you have large trees near your property, schedule routine drain inspections to catch root ingress early.

## 5. Collapsed or Damaged Pipes

Older properties in Suffolk and surrounding areas often have clay or cast iron drainage pipes. These can crack, shift or collapse over time due to ground movement, tree roots or general wear and tear. When that happens, water can’t flow through properly and you might notice gurgling sounds, foul smells or flooding.

As a trusted drain plumber in Suffolk, we use CCTV drain surveys to diagnose structural issues and recommend the most effective repair.

## 6. Blocked Gullies and Outdoor Drains

External drains collect rainwater and wastewater from kitchens or bathrooms. If these get blocked by leaves, soil or debris, water backs up fast, often leading to surface flooding or damp patches around the home.

Tip: Keep gullies and outdoor drains clear by removing debris after storms or heavy rain.

## 7. Misconnected Pipes

In some homes, especially those with extensions or older conversions, pipes may have been connected incorrectly. For example, a washing machine or dishwasher may be draining into a surface water system rather than a foul sewer. This can cause contamination and blockages.

Tip: If you’re unsure, ask for a drain survey to check everything is connected properly.

## 8. Soap Scum and Limescale

Soap may seem harmless, but it can combine with hard water minerals to form limescale. This builds up over time on the inner walls of pipes, especially in homes with older plumbing. The narrower the pipes become, the more likely they are to get blocked by hair or debris.

Tip: Use water softeners or limescale-reducing products if you live in a hard water area.

## 9. Heavy Rainfall Overloading the System

Sudden downpours can overwhelm even well-maintained drains, especially if they’re partially blocked or old. In areas like Norfolk and Suffolk, where rural drainage systems may be outdated, this is a common cause of emergency call-outs.

Tip: Keep gutters and drains clear and have your system checked before storm season.

## 10. DIY Disasters

Sometimes well-meaning DIY work leads to big drainage problems. Accidentally driving a screw through a pipe or fitting the wrong size trap can cause leaks or misflows. We’ve helped many customers fix issues caused by poor installations.

Tip: If in doubt, call in a professional before making changes to your plumbing.
