    question: "What causes drains to become blocked?",
    answer:
      "Blocked drains are commonly caused by grease, food waste, wipes, hair, soap residue, scale build-up or tree roots entering the pipework.",
    category: "blocked-drains",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Can you clear recurring drain blockages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. If a blockage keeps returning, we can investigate the underlying cause using CCTV inspection and recommend a long-term solution rather than a temporary fix.",

    id: 8,
    question: "How quickly can a blocked drain be cleared?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "What is a CCTV drainage survey?",
    answer:
      "A CCTV drainage survey uses a specialist camera to inspect the inside of your drains, identifying issues such as blockages, cracks, root intrusion or pipe collapse.",
    category: "cctv",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "When should I have a CCTV drain survey?",
    answer:
      "CCTV surveys are recommended for recurring blockages, unexplained drainage issues, or before purchasing a property to identify hidden problems.",
    category: "cctv",
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "Do CCTV surveys cause disruption?",
    answer:
      "No. CCTV inspections are non-invasive and carried out through existing access points, with no digging required.",

    question: "What is high pressure water jetting?",
    answer:
      "High pressure water jetting uses powerful water jets to remove stubborn blockages, grease, scale and debris from inside drainage pipes.",
    category: "jetting",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    question: "Is water jetting safe for drains?",
    answer:
      "Yes. When carried out by trained professionals, jetting is a safe and effective method suitable for most drainage systems.",
    category: "jetting",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    question: "When is jetting better than rodding?",
    answer:
      "Jetting is often more effective for heavy build-up, grease, scale and recurring blockages where rodding alone may not fully clear the pipe.",
    category: "jetting",
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    question: "Can jetting prevent future blockages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. By thoroughly cleaning the pipe interior, jetting reduces the chance of debris building up again quickly.",
    category: "jetting",
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    question: "Do you use jetting for commercial drainage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. High pressure jetting is commonly used for commercial sites where drains experience higher usage and heavier build-up.",

    question: "What is a patch liner repair?",
    answer:
      "A patch liner is an internal repair method that seals cracks or damaged sections of pipe without excavation.",
    category: "repairs",
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    question: "When is no-dig repair suitable?",
    answer:
      "No-dig repairs are suitable for localised damage such as cracks, small fractures or joint defects where the rest of the pipe is in good condition.",
    category: "repairs",
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    question: "Is patch lining permanent?",
    answer:
      "Patch lining provides a long-lasting repair, extending the life of the pipe and preventing leaks or root ingress.",
    category: "repairs",
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    question: "Does patch lining require digging?",
    answer:
      "No. Repairs are carried out internally through existing access points, avoiding disruption to floors, gardens or driveways.",
    category: "repairs",
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    question: "How do I know if patch lining is right for my drain?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    id: 26,
    question: "How do tree roots get into drains?",

  },
  {
    id: 28,
    question: "Can roots be removed without replacing the pipe?",
    answer:
      "In many cases, yes. Roots can be removed and the pipe repaired internally using patch lining or no-dig methods.",

  },
  {
    id: 29,
    question: "Will roots grow back after removal?",
    answer:
      "If the pipe is properly repaired after removal, the risk of regrowth is significantly reduced.",

  },
  {
    id: 30,
    question: "How can I tell if roots are causing my drainage issue?",
    answer:
